## Home of the Marathon Speedrun Developers.

devel.marathonruns.net is the official, certified fresh portal of the Marathon Speedrun Developers.

## What do we do?

We're responsible for the following projects:

- **[mirata](mirata.md)**, a package-manager and launcher for AlephOne and other source ports.
- **[mrupload classic](mruploadclassic.md)**, an application used for uploading runs and their metadata to the leader-board on systems that would make people say "Please get a new computer".
- **Unofficial [nightly](nightly.md) builds of AlephOne.**
- **alf-deux**, a downstream for AlephOne that backports certain fixes from the, at the time, upcoming 1.3 release to the stable 1.2.1.  

And other fun things! All of these projects are licensed under either (L)GPL3, MIT License or 3-Clause BSD License.

## Who are we?

### tbcr: Lateral Thinking Extraordinaire, Project Manager.
tbcr is a RHCE certified engineer by trade who plays games fast and develops things for said games. He admins marathonruns.net, a speed-run leader-board site for games running on Bungie's Marathon Engine. Ask him about bad movies if you ever meet him in person.

### hyp3rdriv3: Sysadmin
hyp3rdriv3 is a 25 year old human male who lives in the DC metro. He is responsible for maintaining our Atlassian instances including [Bamboo](https://bamboo.marathonruns.net), [JIRA](https://jira.marathonruns.net), and [Confluence](https://marathonspeedrun.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MRUNS/overview), and he is the only one batshit crazy enough to whack them into submission when they act up.

### ObsidianCarnageX12: The Other Lateral Thinker
Living in the frozen tundra known as Alberta, Obsidian is the only one of the group that (currently and somewhat) does programming for a living. Along with tbcr, they are responsible for both absurd strategies in speedrunning and absurd projects.  

### ApertureGrillz:
The ruin-er of tbcr's hopes and dreams. It is written..... that whenever tbcr gets a WR, aperturegrillz will soon follow to crush it considerably.  

All-in-all, aperture works on Chocothon, alf-deux and the leaderboard website.

### 2Tie: Person that needs to sub 2Tie in Marathon 2: Durandal
They work on chocothon and will eternally be hounded by tbcr to Finish Durandal(tm), even in the afterlife.  

### Aaron: Part-time speedrunner, full-time vidmaster, on sabbatical from finishing a project.    
"All over the ship, dancing through the wreckage
of the Pfhor computer core,

<s>DURANDAL</s> AARON WAS LAUGHING"

tbcr and Aaron both manage the marathonruns.net YouTube channel and Vidmaster channel. On the side, Aaron is a prolific developer on various third-party scenarios.  

### Backflip9: Does a thing on another leaderboard site

One of the admins and web developers of Haloruns, they are also helping with the development of the marathonruns site as well.

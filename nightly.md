# Nightly Aleph One Builds
## There be dragons here.

The team produces **unoffical** and **experimental** nightly builds of Aleph One, the modern Marathon engine.

We generate them for the following platforms, though they may or may not work at any given time:

* Windows x32
* Windows x64
* Fedora 29 x64
* Ubuntu 18.04 x64
* RHEL 7 z64 (because YOLO)

And additonally, we also produce snapfiles of the game for experimental use that can be used on many more platforms.

You can read more on our [Confluence](https://marathonspeedrun.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AO/overview), and play with these builds on our [Bamboo](https://bamboo.marathonruns.net). Additonally, if you encounter any bugs with our builds, put them on our [JIRA](https://jira.marathonruns.net).

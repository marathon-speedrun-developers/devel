# Nightly AlephOne Builds
## Thar be dragons here.

Would you like to try the latest and greatest of a source port that only gets a new stable release about every 5 years? If for some reason the answer to that question is yes, you're in luck! The M-S-D folks are enduring the pain that is cross-compilation using MXE and producing **unofficial** and **experimental** nightly builds of AlephOne, the longest-developed source port for the Marathon Engine. This is so bleeding edge, real-life papercuts may occur from usage (This may not actually occur. If it does, consult a parapsychologist).

These builds are painstakingly generated in the finest space heaters known as the marathonruns Bamboo cluster for the following platforms, though they may or may not work at any given time:

* Windows x32
* Windows x64
* Fedora x64 (No specific number since we're targeting latest version)
* Ubuntu 20.04 x64 (20.04 builds coming *soonish*)
* Mac OS X and 11 (Coming Soon)

And additionally, we also produce the modern miracles known as snapfiles of the game for experimental use that can be used on many more platforms. AppImage support is planned but not certain at this time.

You can read more on our [Confluence](https://marathonspeedrun.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AO/overview), and play with these builds on our [Bamboo](https://bamboo.marathonruns.net). Additionally, if you encounter any bugs with our builds, put them on our [JIRA](https://marathonspeedrun.atlassian.net/projects/A1N/issues). If you bug Treellama and company about nightly builds, you give them full right to tease you about not reading this blurb. tbcr and Hyp3rDriv3 will also probably get on your case since they check notification emails for github almost constantly.

These will eventually be used as part of [Mirata](mirata.md).

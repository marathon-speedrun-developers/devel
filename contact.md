# HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH US

### Email
Yes, that's right! Email, that thing you probably don't check too much (just like the mailbox outside your house that is probably stuffed to the brim with unread mail). If you have any question regarding any site issues, please reach out to marathonspeedruns@gmail.com. tbcr is the one that manages this email and anything sent to this address will popup on his development machines, so he will definitely see it (unless he disappears for the weekend to see relatives in middle-o-nowhere, NC)  

### IRC
Yes, that thing that most internet people are not using because Discord and other services are a thing. If for some reason you do use IRC (which if you have used the chat on Twitch, you have), you can reach out to us in the #chocothon channel on [freenode](https://freenode.net/).  

### Discord
Yes, that thing that insists on using the Electron framework because they think it looks cool despite it really hampering system performance since it is just a fancy web browser. This is the most direct way of reaching out to us as this is the discord that is used for both development of the main site in addition to the discord that people use for working on the games themselves. You can find a link to the discord [here](https://discord.gg/nAedm8z) (unless you're one of those people that have hit the server limit and can't leave any, then pick any other option).

# Mirata
# An Installation and Scenerio Manager for Aleph One

Mirata is a very much in development installation and scenario manager for Aleph One. Our goal is to make location, installation, and housekeeping of your Marathon engine games the only easy thing you will do with this game.

All of our current documentation is available at our [Confluence](https://marathonspeedrun.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MIR), and our code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/marathon-speedrun-developers/mirata). Also, feel free to take a gander at our [JIRA](https://jira.marathonruns.net/projects/MIR/issues/MIR-1?filter=allopenissues).

# Mirata
# A launcher (and somewhat package manager) for Marathon source ports.

Mirata is a very much in-development package manager for AlephOne and other source ports that install the appropriate versions and manages scenarios. Our goal is to make location, installation, and housekeeping of your Marathon engine games the only easy thing you will do with this game.

All of our current documentation is available at our [Confluence](https://marathonspeedrun.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MIR), and our code is (currently) on [GitHub](https://github.com/marathon-speedrun-developers/mirata). Also, feel free to take a gander at our [JIRA](https://jira.marathonruns.net/projects/MIR/issues/MIR-1?filter=allopenissues).

# Chocothon
## A Chocolate-like port of the Marathon Trilogy.

Chocothon is an attempt to make a source port that is as accurate as possible to the original Macintosh versions (with some concessions). Unlike AlephOne, Chocothon will respect the original limits for maps(Polygon, Visual, Monster, etc).

I know what you're gonna say....."Woah their friend....Why bother making a new source port...there is AlephOne...", to which we reply, why not? Doom has like a bevy of source ports, Marathon has basically \*Checks Notes\* 3.

Certain game-breaking issues (Divide by Zero, Heartbeat bug, infamous mouse issue in the original game) will be fixed while minor bug behavior is kept. This is why it is considered "Chocolate-like" instead of a chocolate port.
